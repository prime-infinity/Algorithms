this implementation is a simple selection sort. Here we define a pointer and set it to zero(0). we loop through the array, starting from the pointer, and at every time, we find the lowest value among the values and this lowest value is swapped with the value of the index of the pointer,
after which we increment the pointer and loop through the values of the array starting from the incremented index, again finding the lowest value and swapping it with the value on the index position of the pointer.
