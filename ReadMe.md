understanding various algorithms by implementing them.

the purpose for this is simply to have a deeper understanding

the explanations are in the javascript files are always because that is the language i have the most experience in,but a simple overview is always in the "notes.md" files in each folder

the codes here are not generated by chatGPT or any other code generating tool,(except where specified, (for much more theoritical algorithms))
